# Miss Failover Example Configuration
# This configuration demonstrates the miss_failover strategy which sends requests
# to all backends simultaneously and returns the first non-empty response,
# with priority given to backends based on their order.

listeners:
  memcached:
    bind: "0.0.0.0:22122"

backends:
  cache2:
    type: "memcached"
    server: "memcached2:11211"  # Primary cache server

  cache3:
    type: "memcached"
    server: "memcached3:11211"  # Secondary cache server

  cache4:
    type: "memcached"
    server: "memcached4:11211"  # Tertiary cache server

pools:
  miss_failover_pool:
    backends: ["cache2", "cache3", "cache4"]
    strategy:
      type: "miss_failover"

routes:
  cache_route:
    matcher: "*"  # Match all keys
    pool: "miss_failover_pool"

# How it works:
# 1. Client sends GET request for key "user:123"
# 2. Proxy sends the request to ALL three cache servers simultaneously
# 3. If cache1 returns a value first, that's returned to client
# 4. If cache1 returns empty but cache2 has the value, cache2's response is used
# 5. If cache1 and cache2 are empty but cache3 has the value, cache3's response is used
# 6. Priority is given to earlier servers in the list (cache1 > cache2 > cache3)
#
# This provides:
# - Fast response times (concurrent requests)
# - Value failover (not just connection failover)
# - Automatic fallback when primary cache has cache misses
# - Useful for cache warming scenarios or when caches have different data sets
